        <p class="Left_Align">Forests occupy an estimated 31% of the land mass on the planet covering around 4.06 billion hectares in area. This much forested area is found among various ecosystems, right from the dense rainfall forests of the Amazon and Congo Basins, tropical coniferous forests in the Archipelagos, and boreal forests of northern Russia and Canada. Almost 45% of the cover is from tropical rain forests, but this mix of tropical and temperate climate adaptations is rich in species and is very important for climate control on the planet. Temperate forests, which represent 20% of the total forest area, are found in North America, Europe, and some other regions of Asia, while the boreal forest or taiga which takes about 27% distribution is found in upper latitude areas mostly in Siberia, Canada and Alaska region. It is also important to note that these forests are good carbon sinks where they hold 45% of carbon on land respective of their share and sequester tons of carbon dioxide on a yearly basis to reduce global warming impacts. Nevertheless, forests are under very serious threats with more than 10 million hectares crying every year due to deforestation for agriculture, logging and infrastructure. More and more, such measures as the Decade of Restoration of Ecosystems initiated by the United Nations, reforestation programs and similar campaign are important for their survival. The forests are critical for the biodiversity of the planet as they hold 80% of the land-based species and also provide means of survival for more than 1.6 billion people. For the ecological balance to be achieved, wildlife protection and all round forest cover restoration efforts must be prioritized.</p>

        <!--Bio created by ChatGPT from following prompt:create a bio for someone named Eleana Domanic, who is President of True North Consulting GIS consulting firm -->
        <p class="Right_Align"> There is an extensive range of forests in any geographical region of the earth. This is an analysis of the forest cover in major continents:
        <ul><li><b>
          South America:</b> Accounts for approximately 21% of total forest cover in the world, mainly due to its Amazon rainforest popular in several countries and which happens to be the most extensive tropical foreset in the world.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>Europe (Including Russia):</b> Europe occupies 25% of the entire area covered by forest, out of which a big proportion belongs to Russia. Together with the East European plain, the boreal forests of Russia are among the largest expanse of forests that are in one piece on the globe.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>North America:</b> Forests consume up to 16% of the total area under forests in, most especially in Canada and the United States, where there are extensive temperate and boreal forests.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>Africa:</b> Occupies over 17% of the world’s tree cover mainly in the wet guinean forests of the congo basin although this region was the most extensive seemingly after the amazon basin.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>Asia:</b> Comprises 15% of the forests of the planet mainly comprising tropical and boreal forests with many of the predominant pockets located in Southeat Asia and Siberia.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>Oceania:</b> Comprises close to 5% of the forests of the planet. At the same time there are big forested territories in the Continent of Australia, islands of Papua New Guinea and ancient New Zeland.</li></ul></p>

        <p class="Right_Align"> On the entire planet, there are three broad tree types classified.
        <ul><li><b>
          Tropical Forests:</b> Tropical forests occupy approximately 45% of the world’s forest cover and are located on the equator along the Amazon, the Congo basin, and Southeast Asia. Tropical forests have thicker plant structure and a greater diversity of life than any other biome.</li><br>
          
        <li><b>Temperate Forests:</b> These forests cover an estimated 20% of the total forest cover found in regions such as North America, Europe, and some parts in Asia. These forests undergo seasonal changes and contain a number of plant and animal species.</li><br>
          
        <li><b>Boreal Forests:</b> Also referred to as Taiga, these forests make about 27% of the total forests across the globe and are mostly situated in Russia, Canada and Alaska. Boreal forests play an important role in carbon sequestration owing to their vast areas of peatlands.</li></ul></p>

        <h3>Impact of Afforestation and reforestation<img src="Images/globe1.png" alt="Bruno Greggor in stick figure drawing form" class ="R_Image MMImage" width="90" height="90"></h3>
        <h4>Afforestation and reforestation help</h4>
        <!--Bio created by ChatGPT from following prompt:create a bio for someone named Bruno Greggor who is gerneral manager of True North Consulting and GIS firm-->
        <p class="Right_Align"> 
          Afforestation and reforestation are essential for restoring ecological balance and addressing the pressing issue of climate change. By sequestering large amounts of CO₂, forests act as natural carbon sinks, playing a critical role in reducing greenhouse gases and stabilizing global temperatures. Beyond their climate benefits, forests help regulate the water cycle, intercepting rainfall and allowing it to percolate into groundwater, which stabilizes stream flows and reduces the severity of droughts and floods. Reforestation also prevents soil erosion by anchoring soil with tree roots, which maintains land fertility and reduces sedimentation in rivers and water bodies, preserving aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, forests create vital habitats for countless species, from birds and mammals to insects and plants, enhancing biodiversity and providing corridors for wildlife movement that prevent genetic isolation. For nearby communities, reforestation brings economic opportunities through sustainable harvesting of resources such as timber, nuts, fruits, and medicinal plants, and it supports eco-tourism, which provides livelihoods and fosters environmental stewardship. Furthermore, forests improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen, contributing to healthier communities. These forests not only protect and sustain life today but also lay the foundation for a resilient ecosystem capable of adapting to future environmental changes, ensuring a sustainable planet for future generations.</p>
